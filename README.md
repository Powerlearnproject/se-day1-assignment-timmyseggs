#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering systematically applies engineering principles and methods to develop and maintain high-quality software systems.
Its importance lies in enabling the creation of software applications and systems that facilitate modern technology and lifestyle.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1. The Birth of Programming Languages(1950s-1960s):- this era saw the shift from machine code to high level languages such as FORTRAN and COBOL
2. The Establishment of Software Engineering as a Discipline(1960s-1970s):- software engineering was recognized as a distinct field and this era saw the introduction of structured programming, top-down design, and other methodologies aimed at improving software quality and maintainability.
3. The Rise of Agile Methodologies(2000s):-Agile methodologies emerged in the 2000s, emphasizing flexibility, customer collaboration, and iterative development. Popular frameworks like Scrum and Kanban helped popularize this approach.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Requirement:- getting user and system requirements for the software.
2. Design:- creating high level designs of software architecture and user interface.
3. Implementation:- Writing of the code and building software according to the design specifications.
4. Testing:- Running of several tests to ensure that the software runs properly and meets the requirements.
5. Deployment:- This is releasing the software to users or customers.
6. Maintenance:-providing constant updates, servicing and enhancements of the software after it has been deployed.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall is sequential and rigid, while Agile is iterative and flexible. Waterfall is better for stable projects, and Agile is better for projects with changing requirements.
waterfall is suitable for software projects that the requirements are relatively fixed, While Agile is suitable for software projects that have changing requirements either from user feedback or from ongoing trends.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

1. Software Developer:- A software developer Creates, writes, and maintains code for software applications.
2. Quality Assurance Engineer:- A quality assurance engineer tests the software and ensures that the software meets the specified requirements and standards.
3. Project Manager:- A project manager plan, organize, and coordinate the software development process.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs provide a comprehensive environment for writing, testing, and debugging code. They often include features like code completion, syntax highlighting, debugging tools, and integration with version control systems. Examples include Visual Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, and Eclipse.

VCS track changes to code over time, allowing developers to collaborate effectively and revert to previous versions if needed. They also help manage different versions of the codebase, preventing conflicts and ensuring a consistent development process. Examples include Git, SVN, and Mercurial.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Challenges
1. Changing requirements.
2. Tight deadlines.
3. Technical debt.

Solutions
1. Implementation of Agile methodology.
2. Regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.
3. Improving code quality and automated testing.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

1. Unit:- Testing individual components or modules of the software.
Importance:- Helps identify and fix defects early in the development process, reducing the cost of fixing them later.

2. Integration:- Testing the interaction between different components of the software.
Importance:- Helps identify interface issues and integration defects that may not be apparent in unit testing.

3. System:- Testing the software as a whole.
Importance:- Ensures that the software meets the overall business objectives and user expectations.

4. Acceptance:- Testing the software with user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
Importance:- Ensures that the software is ready for deployment and meets the customer's expectations.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the art of crafting effective questions or instructions to guide AI models to generate the best result.
It ensures clear communication, eliminates ambiguity and helps tailor a desired, clear and concise response from the AI.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

"Tell me about history"- vague
"Tell me about the history of colonialism in Nigeria" - improved

The improved prompt is very effective because it provides context and allows the AI to clearly understand what you're talking about so it can provide a specific and accurate response.
